# Module One Final Project

Welcome to the Weather App, your command line source for all your weather needs. Using the weather app is easy, to get started just type ruby bin/run.rb and hit enter to enter the app. Once inside the program	 you can view the temperature and conditions of your chosen city. Once you view that city you can save your city to a list of cities that you can view and get weather updates at your leisure. Accidentally entered the wrong city? No problem you can delete it from your list in 2 easy steps, just select the city to delete and delete it!
And of course you can get an updated weather condition anytime you want, just enter the city again and we’ll give you an up to the minute weather report.
When you’re all done simply select the option to exit the app.
Ok bye bye, hope to see you again soon!

Sincerely,

The Weather App Team
